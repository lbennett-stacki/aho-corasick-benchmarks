	"prose": "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way. In short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\nThere were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.\nIt was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. Had the method been discovered of working the problem backwards from the answer, it would have been quite as simple and as useful. But the machinery of the law was still in motion, and the hand that was laid upon the suffering creature was the hand of the law.\nThe Dover road lay, as to the traveller, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter's Hill. He walked uphill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did, not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath.\nWith drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary old hush of whoa then the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill.\nWhenever the guard came to that conclusion, he sent word through the passengers that they had better get down and walk. And the passengers, if there were only two of them, made up their minds to do it, and set about it; and if there were twenty of them, they made up their minds to do it, and set about it; and the coach lurched on without them, and they scrambled after it, some upon the footway and some in the road.\nThe great North Road had long stretches of loneliness in those days and the journey from London to the northern towns was tedious and dangerous, with highwaymen and footpads adding their own perils to those of nature. The travellers who ventured upon this road were stout of heart and strong of purpose, for they knew that every mile brought fresh challenges.\nScience and learning were making their slow advance through the country, and the universities were beginning to open their doors a little wider. The great questions of the age were being debated in coffee houses and meeting halls, where men of every station gathered to discuss the matters that affected their daily lives. Philosophy and natural history were popular subjects, and many a gentleman considered himself something of an expert.\nThe children played in the streets while their mothers watched from doorways. Market day brought farmers from the surrounding countryside with their produce, and the town square would fill with the sounds of commerce and conversation. Fresh bread from the bakery, fish from the river, vegetables from the garden, and meat from the butcher all found their way to the family table.\nIn the evening, the family would gather around the fire, and the father would read aloud from whatever book or newspaper had come to hand. The mother would sew or knit, and the children would listen with wide eyes to stories of far-off lands and great adventures. It was a simple life, but it had its pleasures and its comforts, and they were content."
